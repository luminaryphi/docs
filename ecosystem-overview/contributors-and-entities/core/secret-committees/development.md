# Development

The Development Committeeâ€™s purpose is to foster a space for developers and teams to collaborate on the latest developments within Secret Network. The Committee will hold itself to the following core responsibilities:

1. Committee Meetings hosted every Monday at 5:00 PM UTC
2. Create [Community Code Repositories](../../../funding/ccr-and-ccbl.md) with tightly scoped acceptance criteria (AC). Offer micro-bounties to any person or company who submits a PR that satisfies all AC. These projects are designed to be completed in 1 to 5 working days depending on the experience level of the contributor and complexity of the project.
3. Appropriate funds to a Mentorship Program, whereas an experienced developer will be compensated to pair up with with a new mentee who is looking for a faster onramp into the Network. The Development committee consists of Lumi, Sandman Srdtrk, and Xiphiar, who can be contacted in the #development channels in Discord.
